# Yarn-Cloth
A yarn cloth rendering implemented by XPBD and OpenGL. Final project for CS 6610 at University of Utah.

## Model Source
The yarn-level cloth models comes from http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/yarnmodels.  

I generally use the BCC file for effective loading. Please refer to the original website to look up its specification.
